# Testing workflow

This product uses mock-first development while keeping a narrow path to real-service evidence.

The default test suite must be safe to run offline and must never require credentials.

Windows Core storage tests use real DPAPI CurrentUser with synthetic values and injected temporary
AppData roots. They cover encrypted persistence, application/profile/name binding, corruption,
concurrent publication, cleanup and the default CLI store. They never access Credential Manager
or real profiles. Other platforms skip the Windows-native tests and retain keyring-backed storage.

## The auth-first development loop

1. Start with a walking skeleton: profile fields, authentication, and the cheapest identity/status
   command that proves the service is reachable.
2. Build the real CLI and configure a named current-user profile through `profile configure`; let
   the normal platform secret store own its secret.
3. Run the integration's explicit local read-only proof through the packaged CLI process.
4. Inspect only the fields needed for the next user-visible command. Obtain them from that proof or
   from official documentation.
5. Sanitize the smallest useful example before it enters the repository.
6. Write an MSW handler at the native `fetch` boundary and a failing client/command test.
7. For side effects, prove a disabled permission rejects before the MSW handler is reached.
8. Implement only the behavior required by that test, then re-run the local proof while debugging.
9. Run focused mocked tests and the repository check before merging.

This is TDD with service evidence: authentication opens the door to discover the real contract;
mocked tests make the discovered contract fast, deterministic, and reviewable.

## Fixture safety

Never commit:

- access/refresh tokens, cookies, authorization headers, passwords, or private keys;
- internal user e-mail addresses or personal names;
- private hostnames unless the repository owner has explicitly made them part of the product;
- build logs, source fragments, artifact URLs with signatures, or environment variables;
- identifiers that are not required to explain the contract.

Prefer the smallest hand-authored fixture that preserves the fields the client consumes. If a
recorded response is used, redact it before saving and review the staged diff as if it were public.
Tests should fail when required fields drift, not snapshot every byte returned by a service.

## Test tiers

| Tier | Runs by default | Purpose |
|---|---:|---|
| Unit | Yes | Command definitions, output, profile and auth behavior |
| Mocked service | Yes | HTTP request/response contracts through MSW |
| CLI process | Yes | Actual command links/shims, exit/stdio, cancellation and shutdown |
| Local profile-backed proof | Never | Explicit development/debug evidence through a real CLI profile |

`npm run test:package` is a separate distribution check in CI. It may download public
npm dependencies, but never contacts a service. It checks actual archives and
installs them into a temporary global prefix outside the repository, then exercises npm's
real command links/shims with help, version and persistent RPC. JSON profile listing uses
the installed integration exports and Core's temporary fixture. It never accesses real
profiles or credentials. See [product release](release.md) for the exact release set and gates.

## Local profile-backed integration proof

Every real integration should grow one explicit proof command as soon as authentication works. The
proof uses the compiled executable, a required profile name, the normal current-user profile store,
and the normal platform secret store. It must not accept a test-only endpoint or credential: URL/token injection
can prove a client while bypassing the product path that users actually depend on.

The proof is physically separate from unit/mocked test globs and from `npm test`. Its script refuses
known CI environments before starting a child process or network call. Do not add it to GitHub
Actions, scheduled automation, release workflows, or a generic workspace test command. Running it is
an explicit local developer action and its result is proof-of-work for the current machine/profile,
not a merge gate or availability monitor.

Safety comes from construction:

- require an explicit profile and invoke only the packaged CLI;
- keep a fixed internal command inventory containing only bounded `ReadOnly` leaves;
- never accept arbitrary argv, even if the selected profile currently has `Update` enabled;
- limit collection sizes and treat empty pages as valid, with dependent detail calls skipped;
- parse responses in memory and print only method/pass/count summaries;
- never persist raw payloads, credentials, discovered URLs, IDs, logs, or proof artifacts;
- convert any useful real response into a separately reviewed, minimal sanitized MSW fixture.

Mocked tests remain the durable regression suite because they are deterministic and safe. The local
proof answers a different question: “Does the real built product work with this real profile now?”

Integrations import the separate `@eyeauras/cli-factory/proof` entry. Their runners call
`parseProofProfile(argv, environment)` before invoking even an injected test invoker. It accepts
only `--profile <name>` using Core's profile-name rules. CI preflight recognizes nonempty `CI`,
`GITHUB_ACTIONS`, `TF_BUILD`, `BUILD_BUILDID`, `TEAMCITY_VERSION`, `JENKINS_URL` and `BUILDKITE`
variables regardless of casing; a value of `false` still means the variable is present.

`createProofInvoker({ executable, environment?, credentialEnvironment?, timeoutMs?, maxOutputBytes? })`
takes a packaged-entry file URL and returns a function accepting code-owned `{ argv, stdin? }`.
It checks CI again before every spawn, removes named credential variables case-insensitively,
closes stdin after writing, and returns stdout only on exit zero. Defaults are 30 seconds per child
and 65,536 bytes **per stream**, with stderr drained without retention. Limits must be positive
safe integers; timeout is at most 2,147,483,647 ms. Startup/input/output failure, timeout and byte
overflow terminate the child and close its pipes before settlement; errors never include raw child
diagnostics. Integration code parses JSON/RPC and prints only its own safe method/count summaries.

Offline Core tests use synthetic Node children to exercise this process boundary without profiles,
keyrings or a network. Integration tests still assert their complete fixed inventories and service
shapes. Success requires the expected number of rows, at least one passed row, and no failed rows;
dependent skips cannot hide a failed source read. There is no shared endpoint registry or report DSL.

### Independent products

Each product repository owns its fixed local proof inventory, synthetic HTTP contracts and
installed-package acceptance. Factory release checks use a small service-neutral Core fixture;
there is no dependency on product source, service DTOs or a real service.

## Cross-tool redirect and diagnostic contract

Core's deterministic output subprocess fixture waits for its parent to close the reader before
writing help/version, human/JSON results, NDJSON and RPC. It asserts exit 141, quiet stderr and
resource/iterator cleanup. Write-boundary tests cover small asynchronous EIO failures, handler EPIPE,
cleanup failures and cancellation followed by late EPIPE without process-global listeners.
Installed Core checks close the stdout reader of a synthetic executable for help, NDJSON and RPC;
on Unix they also exercise `--help | head -n 1` with `pipefail`.

The [shared policy](DESIGN.md#cross-tool-redirect-and-diagnostic-policy) is exercised offline.
Preserve evidence for these behaviors; tests must not endorse blanket redirect refusal or
destroyed causes:

- Redirect success for ordinary reads, auth validation and downloads; relative Location values,
  same-host HTTP-to-HTTPS with successful authentication, and supported method/body semantics.
  Exercise cross-origin transitions without leaking credentials, loops/redirect limits, and
  non-replayable request bodies. No implicit application retry of an uncertain mutation.
- Core and the in-repository HTTP example exercise the common behavior through their actual
  HTTP boundary; external products own their corresponding regression evidence. Use native fetch against synthetic local servers when mocks cannot establish
  real redirect/header semantics; external network access is not required.
- Contextual English errors retain native type/code, stack and nested causes for DNS, TLS,
  connection, timeout, HTTP, decoding and storage failures. An authentication GET never claims
  an unknown write outcome. Inject synthetic failures to keep these cases deterministic.
- Human stderr contains the explanation, at most one `Cause:` line and `Next:` commands, and no
  stack frame without `--verbose`. With `--verbose`, human, `--json` and JSON-RPC output carry the
  cause chain with frames; without it, JSON and JSON-RPC still carry the chain's names, codes and
  messages. `execute` preserves the complete error object. Assert the concise form exactly and the
  verbose form by content.
- Redaction covers messages, stack headers, nested/aggregate causes and credential-bearing URLs.
  Assert both absence of synthetic secrets and presence of useful cause codes and stack locations;
  an empty or generic diagnostic is not a passing privacy test. Non-Error throws and cycles do
  not crash serialization. Do not snapshot engine-specific full stacks or tool-authored prose.
- English is the standard language of tool-authored output; service/user content is preserved.
  Review authored help, prompts, examples and diagnostics without adding localization machinery.

Core owns shared diagnostic tests; integrations prove service context and actual client behavior.
Use the existing focused suites and run `npm test` before completing runtime implementation.

## Response consumption regressions

The shared response-reader tests cover absent/empty bodies, declared-length syntax and identity
length mismatches, explicit-budget chunked-byte overflow, split UTF-8/BOM bytes, empty chunks and reused
producer buffers, abort/read failures, and deterministic reader-lock cleanup. A synthetic local
HTTP server verifies native fetch decompression: compressed overhead may exceed the decoded bound
when the actual body fits, while decoded overflow still fails. This loopback test uses no profile,
credentials or real service. MSW tests in both integrations retain service decoding, status,
empty/null mutation and privacy contracts, and an unread response clone cannot block cancellation.

## Safe output-file regressions

Core publication tests use only synthetic temporary output directories. They cover basename/path/device
preflight before acquisition, directory links and replacement, private stage/file identity,
complete partial writes, empty and bounded streams, cancellation, validation, no-clobber races,
unsupported hard links, post-link destination replacement and cleanup failure before/after
publication. Replacement tests assert that unknown files are retained rather than deleted.
Integration MSW tests retain 206, Content-Length, stream/cancellation and service format/auth rules.
Encoded whole-file responses skip encoded length equality; explicit caller budgets still enforce
emitted-byte overflow. Default requests and downloads have no local byte ceiling. No live download
belongs in any tier. Installed-package offline smokes cover cwd defaults, relative/absolute output,
profile-independent destinations, persistent RPC collisions, missing parents and retention of old
profile files.

## Required evidence

Shared option-parser regressions cover signed/unsigned decimal spelling, leading zeros, safe bounds,
invalid JSON and non-echoing errors. The diagnostic contract above requires redacted causes
to remain useful. Core exercises required options and declared defaults through CLI, execute and
persistent RPC. Consumers exercise native-fetch paging and invalid input before authentication
in their own tests; Factory retains the generic parser and admission contract.

Changes to application-data behavior use an injected `AppArgumentsEnvironment`; tests never redirect
the real user's folders. Cover the exact `RoamingAppDataDirectory/Profile` composition, separation of
at least two profiles, and deletion of a profile-owned directory when lifecycle semantics change.
For JSON-RPC, prove that two requests selecting different profiles receive different
`AppDataDirectory` values without restarting the process.

External Core source verification belongs to its separately authorized owner. For a product
client/command change, run affected mocked tests. Before a commit intended for `main`, run:

```text
npm test
```

Do not call a test mocked when it bypasses the actual HTTP parsing or command handler under test.
Mock the boundary, not the implementation.

[`integrations.md`](integrations.md).

## Shared offline CLI fixture

Import `createCliFixture` from `@eyeauras/cli-factory/testing`; the ordinary package export
does not initialize or re-export testing utilities. The fixture creates a canonical temporary
root, isolated AppArguments, memory secrets and a real ProfileStore view. Omitted `profiles`
leaves the virtual default unconfigured. Explicit profile entries contain `name`, non-secret
`values`, optional exact `permissions` and optional synthetic `secrets` keyed by credential name.
Nothing logs in, launches a browser, grants Update, installs mocks or contacts a service.

Create every application through `fixture.createApplication(runtime => ...)`. It passes the
isolated runtime to the real integration factory and records its application for disposal.
The exposed ProfileStore supports preparation/inspection of the real document; it is not injected
by default, because Core must preserve the integration's profile defaults and validation.
A non-default `defaultProfile` requires explicit profile preparation to persist that identity.

Register the fixture with the current node:test context before other setup. Cleanup is registered
before profile preparation and application creation; it disposes all registered applications in
reverse order before checking the root's identity and removing only that owned directory.
A changed root is retained and reported. A failed application shutdown also retains temporary data,
since resources may still use it. Failed test assertions still run the registered cleanup.

Use the application's `execute` for domain results and the fixture's `stdout()`, `stderr()` and
`resetOutput()` for existing runtime-stream tests. `run(app, argv, invocation?)` returns
`{ exitCode, stdout, stderr }` using fresh captured streams, fixture cwd and an empty environment
unless explicitly supplied. `json(app, argv, invocation?)` parses successful JSON output;
`rpc(app, commandArgvList, invocation?)` sends successive requests through one real RPC session.
Both require a successful transport/CLI exit; RPC command errors remain response objects.
The raw application's `execute` and `run` retain their normal environment semantics; auth tests
must explicitly provide synthetic environment inputs when those inputs are under test.

Integration support adapters may retain service defaults around this shared fixture. Hostile
file-root and browser/process fixtures remain specialized where their purposes differ; do not
make those service-aware fixture options in Core.

### Shared command-contract assertions

The testing entry point also exports small independent assertions. `assertHttpRequest` checks
an independently authored method, origin/path, exact query (including repeated values), selected
headers and optional JSON/text body. Omitted body means no request body. Service response shaping,
unusual multipart/preflight behavior and MSW handlers remain ordinary integration callbacks.

Wrap a catch-all MSW handler with `trackRequests(t, expectedCount, respond)` and delegate to its
`handle(request)`. It records every request, rejects excess calls and registers final verification
with the test context. Resolver assertion failures are rethrown outside MSW, rather than disappearing
behind the CLI's sanitized HTTP error. Tests still compare the independently authored domain result.

`assertPermissionDenied(app, argv, category, requests)` requires an explicit category and zero
service requests. It never infers permissions or grants them. `assertCliOutput(fixture, app, argv,
expected, humanPattern, requests)` is specifically for repeatable mocked commands with exactly one
HTTP request per invocation: it verifies human and JSON output separately on the same application,
including the per-mode request count. Multi-request workflows retain their direct assertions.
`assertSafeCliFailure` checks exit status, empty stdout, expected stderr and caller-supplied forbidden
patterns. No automatic redaction or broad snapshot comparison is implied.

Consumers own equivalent read/write/RPC/failure examples. These helpers do not infer permission
categories from HTTP methods or replace independent service expectations.



## Diagnostic redaction regressions

Diagnostic redaction regressions must vary each percent hex digit independently while retaining
ordinary-letter case and regex literal semantics, including malformed Unicode. Copy control-bearing
causes before supplying known values, then copy again to prove late redaction and stable escaping.
Check native execute fields and human/JSON/RPC normal and verbose output retain useful codes/frames.

## Product workflow

The actual [product tests and local proof](reference.md#local-proof-and-offline-tests) and
[fixed profile-backed proof runner](../integration-tests/profile-proof.ts) own the service inventory.
Default npm test is offline. npm run test:package exercises installed artifacts with synthetic data;
public dependency downloads do not make it live-service proof. Running the fixed local real-profile
proof requires explicit task authority; it is separate from npm test and refuses CI. This setup
runs no live proof, creates no API inventory and grants no service writes.

Core parser/stdio/DPAPI infrastructure tests remain upstream ownership; product tests prove the
actual client/tree/profile/paging/output behavior. Browser/IPC/RANDOM setup in source documents is
excluded from this standalone HTTP product, not a missing test dependency.
