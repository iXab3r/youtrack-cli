# youtrack-cli — agent router

A standalone YouTrack CLI built on AI CLI Factory. Keep this entry point compact;
product behavior belongs in README/docs and scope in GitHub Issues.

## Framework baseline

This product pins published Core **0.7.1** and its verified release revision
`bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267`. The registry archive matches the approved stage and GitHub Release;
[release.md](docs/release.md) describes independent product qualification and publication.
Keep these instruction links aligned with the exact Core dependency.

Framework laws apply here. Framework paths describe its ownership; this repository owns this
product's service client, DTOs, commands, authentication protocol, pagination and proof inventory.
Do not copy framework implementations. Use an exact npm Core pin and lock; no final workspace,
file or floating Git dependencies.

## Product rules

- Preserve `@eyeauras/youtrack-cli`, executable/application ID `youtrack-cli`, command names,
  profile paths, credential identity, permission categories and 0.7 pagination contracts.
- One declaration tree supplies human/JSON/persistent RPC. Handlers return data. Shared output,
  EPIPE handling, AppData, permissions and secret-store behavior belong to Core.
- All service tests are offline at native fetch/MSW with synthetic profiles and memory secrets.
  Local profile-backed proof is separate, fixed, bounded ReadOnly and refuses CI.
- No deployment addresses, private identities, credentials or unsanitized responses in source,
  tests, notes, issues, logs or release evidence. Inspect the full tracked tree and staged diff
  before every commit. Never force-push or rewrite pushed history.
- TeamCity owns CI: main-only Verify, Cake Frosting and `build/teamcity.sh`; no GitHub Actions.
  Manual release stages the tested tarball; only the owner approves the exact verified stage on npm
  with 2FA. Read [release.md](docs/release.md) before CI or release changes.
- IPC/Playwright are not product dependencies. Keep service semantics local and propose any common
  mechanism separately in Factory within the user's authorized scope.

## Delivery roles

GitHub Issues is the primary tracker. Use the owning integration role plus the relevant function:

- [GH issue dev](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/roles/gh-issue-dev.md) and [lifecycle](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/practices/github-issues.md)
- [Reconciliation Lead](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/roles/reconciliation-lead.md) and [workstreams](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/practices/workstreams.md) for bounded migrations/audits
- [Reviewer](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/roles/reviewer.md) and [independent review](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/blob/bf79b80636bcdd790bbd6c25648842ae5213f267/docs/practices/independent-review.md) for completed changes

New branches default to `bugfix/`. Transient coordination stays Git-ignored under
`.workspace/workstreams/<id>/` of this repository's verified absolute root. Partial PRs have no
closing keywords. Preserve deferred backlog; migration does not implement deferred operations.
Framework-wide official skill policy remains [Factory #29](https://github.com/iXab3r/EyeAuras.CliFactory/issues/29).
